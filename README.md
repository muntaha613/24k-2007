### ***Objective 2: Pseudocode*** 
**TASK 02**
1.	 START
2.	 INPUT variable 1
3.	INPUT variable 2
4.	INPUT variable 3  
5.	 Add variable 1, variable 2 and variable 3
6.	 End

**TASK 03**
1.	 START
2.	 INPUT number 1
3.	 INPUT number 2
4.	 INPUT “+” or “-” operator
5.	 IF the operator is “+” THEN 
6.	               PRINT “number1 + number2”
7.	 ELSE
8.	              PRINT “number1 – number 2”
9.	 End

### ***Objective 3: Algorithm***
**TASK 01**
1	Ask the user to enter number n.
2	Ask the user to enter Nth.
3	Divide Nth by number n if the remainder is zero then Nth is the divisor.
4	Divide Nth by 2 if remainder is zero then Nth is even otherwise Nth is odd.

**TASK 03**
1	Ask the user to enter number A.
2	Ask the user to enter number B.
3	Ask the user to enter the operators (+,-,*,/,%).
4	Set sum to (A + B) if operator is +.
5	Set difference to (A - B) if operator is -.
6	Set product to (A * B) if operator is *.
7	If B is not 0, then set division to (A / B) if operator is /.
8	If B is not 0, then set percentage to (A % B) if operator is %.
