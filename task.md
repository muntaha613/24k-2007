## TASK 01

Ask the user to enter number n.
Ask the user to enter Nth.
Divide Nth by number n if the remainder is zero then Nth is the divisor.
Divide Nth by 2 if remainder is zero then Nth is even otherwise Nth is odd.
## TASK 03

Ask the user to enter number A.
Ask the user to enter number B.
Ask the user to enter the operators (+,-,*,/,%).
Set sum to (A + B) if operator is +.
Set difference to (A - B) if operator is -.
Set product to (A * B) if operator is *.
If B is not 0, then set division to (A / B) if operator is /.
If B is not 0, then set percentage to (A % B) if operator is %.
